3. Add password reset functionality
4. Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
5. Add input validation and sanitization
6. Implement rate limiting
7. Use environment variables for sensitive data
8. Add admin authentication (currently open)
9. Consider using bcryptjs with higher salt rounds
10. Add CSRF protection

## Extending the System

### Add Payment Processing
To integrate Stripe or PayPal:
```javascript
const stripe = require('stripe')('stripe-key');

app.post('/api/payments/charge', async (req, res) => {
    const charge = await stripe.charges.create({
        amount: req.body.amount * 100,
        currency: 'usd',
        source: req.body.token
    });
    // Record payment in database
});
```

### Add Email Notifications
```bash
npm install nodemailer
```

### Generate PDF Invoices
```bash
npm install pdfkit
```

### Add File Attachments
```bash
npm install multer
```

## Troubleshooting

**Server won't start:**
- Check if port 5000 is already in use
- Verify Node.js is installed: `node --version`

**Database errors:**
- Delete `cleaning_service.db` to reset the database
- Run the server again to initialize fresh database

**Login not working:**
- Make sure server is running
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Verify email and password are correct

**CORS errors:**
- The backend has CORS enabled for all origins by default
- For production, specify allowed origins in `cors()` call
